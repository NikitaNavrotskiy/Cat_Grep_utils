with "-" (and not be    ing "-" or "--") is considered an option. The characters in this element (not 
counting the leading "-") are option characters. Each time getopt() is called again , the characte
rs of the next option are returned.



    If getopt() finds an option character, it returns that character, updating the external variable opt
ind and the static variable nextchar so that the next call to getopt() can continue testing from the
next option character or argv element .
